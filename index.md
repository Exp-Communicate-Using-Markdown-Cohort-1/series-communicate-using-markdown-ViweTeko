## Step 3: Add a code example
With this being said: I'd like tp greet you all in Python:
```
$ python3
Python 3.11.2 (main, Mar 13 2023, 12:18:29) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print('Hello world!')
```

Result will be:
```
>>> Hello world!
```
Then exit interactive mode:
```
>>> exit()
$
```
